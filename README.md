## Overview

Welcome to the repository for the Second Best Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithm! This project is an implementation of an algorithm designed to find the second-best Minimum Spanning Tree in graph structures.

## Key Features

- Efficient algorithm for identifying the second-best MST.
- Optimized for performance with large-scale datasets.
- Open-source and available for collaboration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- knowledge of Graph



## Usage

 For finding the Second Best Minimum spanning tree you have to list all of the edges in ascending order according to their cost. Then you have to remove a single edge and Calculate the MST Tree. After calculating you have to restore the previously removed edge and then you have to remove the second edge calculate the mst tree and then restore the previously removed edge. This process will continue for your number of edges. Every time you have to decide on a minimum cost of a tree and store this tree and print this tree.
